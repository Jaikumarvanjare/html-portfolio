<h1>About Myself</h1>

<p>My name is Jai Kumar Vanjare, and I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development, problem-solving, and emerging technologies. I enjoy building projects that combine practical functionality with creativity — from working on web applications to exploring machine learning models.</p>

<p>Alongside academics, I focus on continuous learning through coding challenges, certifications, and research work. I’ve also contributed to a publication on deep learning models, which gave me valuable exposure to teamwork and technical writing.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I value discipline and consistency, whether it’s in studies, fitness, or personal growth. My long-term goal is to grow into a skilled software engineer who can contribute to impactful solutions and keep learning with every challenge.</p>
